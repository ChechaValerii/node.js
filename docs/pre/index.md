# Prerequisites

Before starting you will need to understand what server-side web programming and web frameworks are, ideally by reading the topics in our Server-side website programming. A general knowledge of programming concepts and JavaScript is highly recommended, but not essential to understanding the core concepts.

This website has many useful resources for learning JavaScript in the context of client-side development:

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)<br/>
- [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)<br/>
- [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)<br/>
- [JavaScript (learning)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

The core JavaScript language and concepts are the same for server-side development on Node.js and this material will be relevant. Node.js offers additional APIs for supporting functionality that is useful in browserless environments (e.g., to create HTTP servers and access the file system), but does not support JavaScript APIs for working with the browser and DOM.
